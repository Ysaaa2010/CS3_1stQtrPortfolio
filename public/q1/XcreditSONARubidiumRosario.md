# Key Points I Found Interesting

1. The rollout of the *â‚±20* rice program through **KADIWA** stores really stood out to me. With *â‚±113 billion* behind it, it really shows a strong push towards the affordability of food. Though, I am curious on how long will that be sustainable. It really is quite bold and ambitious, and if it succeeds, it will be a game-changer for *Filipino households who are struggling with the food prices.* It is also one of the those promises that people will really hold the government **accountable** for, so all eyes are definitely on them.

2. The coconut industry industry got a **major** spotlight with a plan to plant *100 million* hybrid coconut trees, starting with 15 million this year. It really is a huge number, and honestly, I did not expect that level of attention on agriculute. What is interesting is that **SONA** framed it as a long term investment in agri-business, exports, and rural livelihood and not just for farming. I never expected that they'll give coconut farming this kind of budget and scale so I'll definitely be watching how this rolls out.

3. Infrastructure-wise, there were a lot of **bold** promises *again* like the *32km* Bataan-Cavite Interlink Bridge, the revival of the "Love Bus", and improvements on PNR and MRT lines. It does feel like they are trying to revive and modernize everything at once. I do hope that it does not just remain in blueprint phase. A lot of people are expecting for these promises to ease daily commutes and economic access.

4. Digital accessibility is *clearly* a focus too like expanding free public Wi-Fi, distributing SIM cards with free data for schools, and the new eGov app combiding over 40 government services. These are the things that I personally think, we *actually* need. It sounds promising, especially for students and families who *rely heavily* on mobile data. The idea of combidning government services into one app is really smart, especially in a country where **bureaucracy** is often a barrier.

# Points I Found Weird

1. The return of the "Love Bus" honestly caught me off guard. It did gave me a slight appreciation to history and heritage, but it made me wonder whether that energy could have been channeled into *improving existing bus systems or strengthening PUV modernization*. Truly, it is charming, but not enirely **relevant**.

2. The goal to electrify over a million household using solar home systems by 2028 felt a bit unrealistic. I support the idea, but the scale seems overy ambitious considering the current infrastructures. Yes, solar power has great potentional especially in the Philippines, but rollout is usually slow and requires consistent policy support and not just one-time funding or promises. I really want to believe in it but it seems a bit too idealistic in the context of how long electrification has taken in the past.

3. The long list of target industries like biotech, critical minerals, and teland Pinoy was interesting, but also quite broad. It did made me wonder how much of it is grounded in an actual strategry. It kind of felt like name-dropping sectors to just sound future-ready without giving any sort of clear direction. I would have appreciated it *more if it had specifics* on which of those are already in development versus on those who are still in the *"we hope to"* stage.

# Reflection

Overall, the President's speech painted a very ambitious picture of the country's future. There was a **clear focus** on expanding infrastructure, supporting our agriculture, and making digital services more open and accessible to ordinary citizens. I really liked how some of the projects like cheaper rice, free Wi-Fi, and improved transport felt very grounded in the daily Filipino struggles. At the same time, I found myself refelcting on the humane side: *will these programs truly reach the farthest barangays, or get stuck in our bureaucratic limbo?* It really is one thing to announce these big plans and budgets, and another thing entirely to ensure that the money actually translates into rice on the tables, power in these homes, and reliable roads in remote towns and **not just in someone's pockets.**

That said, I could not ignore how some parts of the speech felt more like a *wishlist than a road map.* Certain goals lacked detailed timelines or even concrete milestones, leaving me wondering *when* and *how* they'll materialize them. I do not think it is wrong to aim high, but ambitious plans need equally ambitious accountability and mechanisms. Otherwise, public trust could slowly by slowly, **erode.** Personally, I am heavly optimistic by nature, yet I have grown wary of these grand announcements that just seem to fizzle out. So while I am hopeful about the potential impact on the farmers, students, commuters, and every other citizen, I will be watching closely and comparing these promises against actual progress in the coming months. I believe that it is not enough to hear progress, we have to **see** it.

# One Phrase for the Philippines after SONA 2025

### *"Manifesting na hindi ma-gaslight. ðŸ¥°"*

I truly wish that this time, we are are not going to be gaslighted. We have heard enough grand speeches. This time, what we truly want are receipts. We need to feel the change and not just hear about it onstage. So we manfiest. With our eyes wide open, we should see the difference between progress and PR.

Thank you.
