# Reflections - 1st Quarter SY 2025-2026
## Maria Ysabella B. Rosario, 9 - Rubidium

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.  

1. **Basics of JavaScript (Background)**  
   I understand the basic concepts of JavaScript and how it is used to make websites interactive. We discussed how it works differently compared to HTML and CSS, and that helped me see why it is so important in web development. I also learned how to include JavaScript inside an HTML file. This gave me a clear idea of how everything connects together in a webpage. Because of this, I feel like I have a good foundation to move forward with more advanced topics.

2. **JavaScript Variables and Data Types**  
   I now know how to declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`. I also understand the main data types like numbers, strings, and booleans. During class, I also practiced assigning values and saw how they can be updated or changed in a program. That made the lesson more practical and easy to follow and I feel like I have a solid grip on this topic because we had enough exercises to apply it.  

3. **HTML Basics**  
   I learned how to use HTML to structure a webpage. I know how to apply common tags like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Understanding how each tag works helped me organize content on a simple website. I can now see how HTML is the skeleton of any webpage. Practicing it actually made me feel more confident in creating basic website layouts and I really hope that I could learn more of this in the future! (really fun!!!)

4. **CSS Basics**  
   Altought we didn't discuss that much of it, CSS was a fun topic for me because I got to see how it changes the look of a webpage. I practiced applying inline, internal, and external CSS. I also learned how to change colors, fonts, and layouts in a webpage. It made me realize how design plays a big role in user experience. This topic was also probably the most enjoyable out of the since it made my inner-creativeness comeout!

5. **Loops in JavaScript**  
   I understand how loops like `for` and `while` work to repeat tasks in a program. I learned that they are useful because they save time and prevent repetitive coding. For example, instead of typing numbers from 1 to 10, I can just use a loop. Sir Roy’s examples helped me clearly see how loops function in real programs. Moreover, I feel really confident that I can use loops whenever I want, even on paper!

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  
 
1. **Arrays in JavaScript**  
   I understand the concept of arrays and how they can store multiple values in one variable. However, I still get confused with methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, or `.slice()`. Sometimes I forget which one to use for a specific task or I just really get confused how they work in general. I think I need more practice applying them in real examples. Arrays are important and they make work more efficient, so I want to master them better.  

2. **Nested Loops**  
   I know the idea of putting one loop inside another, but it still confuzzles me! I sometimes lose track of which loop is running first or I interchange them. This makes it harder for me to predict the output and even to fix the code.(I have to repeat ittt.) I really think I need to spend more time practicing smaller examples with nested loops or go back to its very basics. If I do them, I know I can understand them better!! 

3. **Comparison Operators**  
   Well, I know how they work and what they are but when you start to combine them? It really pisses and confuses me so much! Coming from c++, I thought this topic would be a breeze but it became one of the hardest topics I've encounterd in Q1. I mean, who would know what (cat!== dog|| (cat!===dog&&cat==dog)) mean right? I think I need to practice more with those cats and dogs and maybe, even harder ones!
 
4. **Logical Operators**  
  Same concept with the Comparison ones! It's easy when its by itself, and hard when you combine them all together. I need to practice more and more to hopefully, improve my analysis of these!

5. **Data Types and Type Conversion**  
   I know the basic data types like numbers, strings, and booleans. But I sometimes get confused when JavaScript automatically converts one type into another. For example, adding a number to a string can give results that I didn’t expect. I also forget how to manually convert values using functions like `Number()` or `String()`. I think I need more examples to really understand how type conversion works.  


## 3. Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.  

1. **Arrays**  
   I will practice using different array methods by writing short programs. For example, I can create a list of names and try adding, removing, or slicing elements. This way, I can get more familiar with how arrays really work. I will also look at more examples online for guidance. The more I practice, the better I will understand them.  

2. **Nested Loops**  
   My plan is to solve small coding problems that use nested loops. I will carefully write them step by step to avoid confusion. Drawing flowcharts can also help me visualize which loop runs first. I think breaking down the logic will make it easier for me. With enough practice, I will become more confident in nested loops.  

3. **Comparison Operators**  
   I will practice combining different operators in a single expression to make sure I understand actually understand how they work. I will also try more complex exercises like those cats and dogs problems. I can also look for online coding challenges that involve comparisons. Practicing these will help me be more confident with my skills.
  
4. **Logical Operators**  
   I plan to write simple programs that use them often! For example, I can create functions that involve them a lot. I'll also try to combine them with Comparison Operators to have a more solid grip on the topic. Over time, I know I will improve.  

5. **Data Types and Type Conversion**  
   I will practice working with different data types in JavaScript, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. I will try exercises that involve mixing types to see how JavaScript automatically converts them. I will also practice manually converting values using functions like `Number()`, `String()`, and `Boolean()`. Testing different scenarios will help me predict the output more accurately. With consistent practice, I can better understand type conversion and avoid unexpected results in my code.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.  

1. **Effective Activities**  
   - Coding exercises really helped me because I could apply what we learned right away. Writing the code myself while Sir Roy explained made me understand better. I felt more confident after finishing the exercises. The feature in KHUB where you can evaluate your code again and again until you get it right also helped alot! That experience made me feel like I actually understood everything Sir taught from Q1.

   - Small projects or bonuses combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were also very effective. These activities showed me how everything connects to create a working webpage. I enjoyed seeing my webpage come to life with both design and interactivity. It motivated me to keep learning and practicing more.

2. **Not Effective Activities**  
   - Just listening to Sir Roy code while thinking I understood it already was not very effective. I realized that I need to type the code myself to actually learn. Without practicing along, I easily forget the steps. Watching alone made me feel like I got it, but later I struggled when coding on my own. This made me understand that participation is more important than just listening.  
   - Copying long code examples without really understanding each part was also not effective. Sometimes I felt like I was just typing without thinking. This didn’t help me connect the logic behind the code. I think it would be better to break down the code in smaller parts first. That way, I can learn step by step and avoid just memorizing.

## *Thank you, sir!*
I had fun this Q1, sir! I actually was not that into cs during gr. 7 and 8 because it was tedious and I was just not interested in that field at all. But grade 9 changed everything! Learning JS, HTML, and CSS were so much fun! I actually started enjoying coding for the very first time without feeling burdened over doing those coding tasks. At some point, I prioritized doing the bonuses you gave po over the requirements that were due. I thank gr. 9 for that! And behind all of that, was you, sir! Yes, coding this grade is fun, but it wouldn't be enjoying with you po! Your energy, vibe, and the way you taught us (well, atleast me!) really rekindled something within me. I am so glad I got you po as my teacher! To 3 more quarters po, sir!
